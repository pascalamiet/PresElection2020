# 2020 US Presidential Election
Data handling scripts for my Bachelor thesis about the impact of COVID-19 on the 2020 US Presidential Election. The files are numbered according to the chapter in the thesis in which the data is used. While the data handling has been done in .ipynb files, the regression outputs were computed with R and then put into LaTeX using the Stargazer package. Those files can be found in the folder `reg_outputs`.

The data is always linked before using it in each script. To run the code yourself, you first have to download the data sets and change the directories to work in your folder structure.

### A couple of outputs:

The change in voting shares for the Democratic candidate from 2016-2020 was calculated per county. The results can be seen below. Most counties increased their share for the Democratic candidate in that time period. Some, on the other hand, increased their voter share for Donald Trump.
