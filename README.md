# 2020 US Presidential Election
Data handling scripts for my Bachelor thesis about the impact of COVID-19 on the 2020 US Presidential Election. The files are numbered according to the chapter in the thesis in which the data is used. While the data handling has been done in .ipynb files, the regression outputes were computed with R and then put into LaTeX using the Stargazer package. Those files can be found in the folder `reg_output`.
